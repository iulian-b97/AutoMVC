  AutoMVC is a web platform dedicated to the field of sales, specifically car sales. 
#
  The application is divided into 3 parts: (Only the first of the three parts is completed, namely the identity management part.)
# 
    1. Identity management part: it is responsible for the user authentication and registration part as well as the role 
                                 management part. For the server side I used IdentityServer 4 with JWT Token and RefreshToken.  
#    
    2. The part for the management of sales ads: it is responsible for the part of viewing, adding and editing the car sale ads 
                                                 , but also for the part of filtering the desired sale ads.
#
    3. Messaging management part: it is responsible for the communication part between the user and the admin for reporting 
                                  a problem in the contact form, but also for the communication part between the buyer and 
                                  the seller.
