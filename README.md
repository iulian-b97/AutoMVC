  AutoMVC is a web platform dedicated to the field of sales, specifically car sales. 
#
  The application is divided into 3 parts: 
# 
    1. Identity management part: it is responsible for the user authentication and registration 
                                 part as well as the role management part. For the server side 
                                 I used IdentityServer 4 with JWT Token and RefreshToken.  
#    
    2. The part for the management of sales ads: it is responsible for the part of viewing, 
                                                 adding and editing the car sale ads, but 
                                                 also for the part of filtering the desired 
                                                 sale ads.
#
    3. Messaging management part: it is responsible for the communication part between the 
                                  user and the admin for reporting a problem in the contact
                                  form, but also for the communication part between the buyer
                                  and the seller.
